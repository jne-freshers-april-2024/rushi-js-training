// ES6 -> EcmaScript 2015
// ES6 introduce new for of loop
// This loop is provide ease of accessing elements of array one by one
// Able to make changes in current array because internally it uses the concept of call by reference.

// number = 5
// let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
// for(let element of arr)
// {
//      console.log(number,"X",element,"=",number*element);
// }    

// Note: when we use for of loop in between asynchronous communication then it pause the execution of aynchronous code until loop execution is completed.


// Features of ES6 :-


/*

1) let and const keyword
2) arrow function
3) Template Literals
